## Course Description

Prerequisites: BIOL 208 and CPSC 230. Students will learn how to use computer programming techniques to solve problems in biology.  Students will learn the structure and capabilities of the Biopython library and will learn how to use how to use it to perform tasks such as automating searches of biological databases, manipulating nucleotide and protein sequences, searching for PCR primers, inferring splicing sites, and investigating DNA mutations. (3 credits)

## Required Software

Download the graphical installer for Continuum Analytics' Anaconda
Python distribution for your platform from
https://www.continuum.io/downloads. Get python version 3.5. This
software is free of charge.

## Instructional Methods/Strategies

Lecture and in-class activities will provide the intellectual theory and conceptual understanding of science underlying computational biology and bioinformatics. Participation in class discussion will be expected and will require reading, searching the web and studying assignments prior to class. Students will write one major paper. Multimedia presentations will enhance student learning.

## Methods of Evaluation

Methods of evaluation will include weekly homework assignments, a
midterm examination and a final project. These will contribute to
grades as follows:

| Work | Proportion |
|------|------------|
|Homework| 60% |
|Midterm| 15%|
|Final Project| 25%|
